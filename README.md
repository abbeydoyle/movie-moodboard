# Movie Moodboard
A site to create movie recommendations from user input

## Description

This project uses html, css, javascript, two third-party APIs to create movie and tv show recommendations based on user input. The first drop down allows the user to select a media type: movie or tv show. The second genre drop down is dependent on this first choice, as movies and tv shows have different genre categories. Submitting these choices saves the search history and populates the page with twenty recommendations and a custom color scheme. 

This project allowed four contributors to in turn test the pair programming model, work in branches, and merge each individual coding style into the larger collaboration project. Further, it solidified the working knowledge of html, css elements, javascript, third-party APIs, and local storage. This project was styled using Tailwind CSS, which was learned entirely throughout the duration of this project.

<!-- ## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer. -->

## Tests

- Select different genres and watch the color scheme change according to your input!
- Watch the input sidebar stick at a fixed position as you scroll through your move/tv show recommendation
- Click on the Github links to be redirected to a contributor's Github portfolio in a new tab
- After your searches, use the Clear Search History button and the page will refresh and local storage will be cleared.



<!-- Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here. -->
